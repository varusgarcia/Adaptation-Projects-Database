        "description": "Building farm-dikes with flap-gates would be a cost efficient strategy to protect farmland from rising sea levels. It is thought that in South Kalimantan over 150,000 ha of re-claimed coastal swampland, which is currently being farmed for rice and other food crops, are at risk. Farm-dikes with flap-gates have been shown to be successful in draining off excess surface and groundwater, providing flood protection, preventing salt intrusion, and controlling water quality. Each farm-dike can be used for 50 years, after which it should be replaced with a new one while the lifespan of a gate is 15 years.",

Restoration includes “coral gardening”, which seeks to rescue temperature tolerant and slow-growing massive corals from situations of overgrowth, extreme shallows, and severe bleaching events. The first step has been to reduce pollution stress on the corals, the community engaged in planting mangroves and improving waste management. Next steps were to plant fast-growing corals and remove the coral-eating crown of thorn starfish. The community also engaged in constructing fish-houses, stone and cement structures that serve as shelter for coral and fish and also absorbing wave energy. A decisive element was to plant the corals in large colonies to promote resistance and survival.",

The wooden shutters open and close with the pressure of the tidal flow and thereby protect the agriculture fields from tidal effects. There are three components which are independent and need to be conserved as one Khazan ecosystem: agricultural fields, fisheries, and sluice gates.",

These are recommended only in limited portions of the coast due to their negative impacts leading to undesirable changes in the beach and due to their prohibitive cost. ",

The focus here would be on response systems that would enable stresses to be kept within the coping range of ecosystems under future climate change, thus increasing resilience and the conservation of key biodiversity. Existing policy systems regarding coastal areas would be adjusted over time to the changing conditions expected under different climate scenarios. Specific guidelines and measures would be included in these procedures to ensure that climate change scenarios are adequately addressed and that those responsible for their application and evaluation are fully trained to implement new approaches and standards. It will address as well specific activities to enhance regulations related to the National Protected Area System as a particular land planning policy with a high potential for coastal ecosystems protection from surrounding environmental stresses. For these purposes, the project will develop communication strategies aimed at reaching specific target groups whose decisions and behaviours affect coastal biodiversity and/or who are affected by climate change. Among them, policy and decision makers, natural resource managers, the media, and stakeholders from key economic sectors related to coastal resources (e.g. fisheries, tourism, and agriculture).",

For communal ngitilis the responsibility lies with the group of elders. •Conservation: Once selected, degraded areas are closed off to protect them from animals for a period of five years to allow regeneration. •Management: Mapping and demarcation of village grazing and cropping areas, together with issuing title deeds, ensures the protection and management of the ngitili. •Protection: Traditional village guards are used to protect the ngitilis, and the community assemblies to formulate sanctions, laws and punishments for misuse. •Order of usage: Farmers prefer to use the communal ngitili first and save private ones until communal feed sources are exhausted. Where an individual ngitili usually covers an area of less than 5 ha (12 acres), a communal ngitili can cover up to 50 ha (124 acres). •Seasonal variations: In the wet season areas are closed off to animals in order to allow vegetation to regenerate.

In the mountains regions of North Africa people used the jessour, an ancient system of collecting run-off from long slopes. Farmers build earthen dams (tabias) across the valley floors to trap the run-off water and silt. Small terraces are created for growing crops and fruit trees that would normally struggle to survive in this arid climate. The Institut des Régions Aride (IRA) together with local farmers developed technologies to improve the jessour and to avoid destruction of the spillways trough heavy rain. Other improvements include the ‘buried stone pocket’ for the localized, underground irrigation of fruit trees to increase the efficiency of water use.",

        "description": "This project seeks to improve agricultural productivity in this increasingly drought-prone region through the implementation of a more efficient system of irrigation which uses a photo-voltaic. The project consists of the installation of an electric water pump powered by solar photovoltaic energy and connected to a drip-irrigation system on a family farm. Furthermore the project aims: Capacity building of small farmers to improve agricultural productivity using water-efficient and affordable technologies that are easy to implement and to use renewable energy for irrigation and to use water efficiently, to actively engage the local community, especially women, in the use of this technology, through participatory processes and to develop a regional replication and dissemination strategy.",

The challenge was to have a consistent process to be able to promote mutual learnings and understand how best to share the information among the project partners. Depending on the type of irrigation system and water pump, the payback time for the system showed to be in the order of 1.5 to 6 years.",

On some plantations pasture grass is grown in between coconut trees to allow cattle to graze. Bananas, black pepper, coffee, ginger, turmeric, betel, vegetables and pineapple are the preferred species because they can grow in shade and provide a good income. The most common crop mixtures in mature coconut plantations are coffee and banana; coffee and pineapple; pineapple and papaya; and banana, coffee and cacao.

        "description": "To harvest the monsoon waters, people in Rajasthan construct small earthen check dams (johads) across seasonally flooded gullies (nalas) which also improve percolation and groundwater recharge. Starting 1984, the last sixteen years have seen the revival of some 3000 johads spread across more than 650 villages in Alwar district. This has resulted in a general rise of the groundwater level by almost 6 m and a 33% increase in the forest cover in the area. Five rivers that used to go dry immediately following the monsoon have now become perennial.",

Three case study reports were produced that summarized current and future livelihood systems and hydrology in each of the 5 ecological zones. To assess future vulnerability, the researchers developed a scenario-driven dataset for a water balance model using the WEAP water planning model for each case study area. The second objective was to identify a comprehensive set of adaptation strategies that address water scarcity and build resiliency in vulnerable communities. Based on the outcome of these adaptation strategy scenarios, recommendations for national policies are being formulated for national adaptation to water stress. ",

Using a computer connected to the internet, the project provided timely information on climate and other development information for the people in the district. While the Internet is not an option in many parts of rural Africa, RANET uses wind-up or solar powered radios to deliver satellite radio broadcasts to remote areas. Not only does RANET provide access to weather and climate information, it also enables remote communities to share information with Africans in other regions. The information enabled the local population to prepare for potential droughts and to take the climate forecast into account when making decisions.",

The project identifies specific climate change adaptation measures and techniques, which are demonstrate at selected project sites. The construction of field rainfall collection and water harvesting works to increase storage and retention of surface runoff and rainfall and mitigate rainfall deficits or insufficient irrigation water resources, especially in dry seasons. Furthermore it helps to compensate for increasingly unbalanced natural rainfall between seasons expected as a result of climate change.",

With this data, local decisions and agreements will be reached. The productive diversification will enable the families to have a more diverse alimentation, to conserve and sustainably manage soils through a system of integrated management of crops (MIC), using techniques such as rotation of crops, incorporation of solid and liquid fertilizers, handling of covers (alive and dead), all of this is harmony with agroforestry systems. Practices inspired in individual and communal experiences will be implemented, and results will be diffused through consciousness-raising sessions, peer to peer training among farmers and “learning by doing”, fairs and sharing of experiences.",

The project will implement the Natural Heritage Reserves (Repano) which consists in the protection of water sources with closures to human and animal activity and which will be managed by local communities. It will also be implemented multi-irrigation systems that will allow water accumulation from low-flow water springs for supplemental irrigation during long periods without rainfalls saving agricultural production. This implicates the construction of 15 irrigation systems in 5 communities in the area of Alto Seco. Each system will store 1500 m3 of water, which will cover the water needs for irrigation purposes. These measures will be designed to allow for more intensive agriculture, reduce land degradation, and help to even-out annual patterns of water availability as rainfall declines and becomes more erratic.",

Okay, now some Comments about this project ;) Activities, which you are mentioned in the comment, belong to the description, in principle. In principle, these are the interesting activities which must be separated described in detail. But as we know from reality there is often not much information about the single activities. However, we want to separated ci:grasp from other project databases by focusing on activities/measures. There for it could be useful to split up projects with many activities into smaller parts dealing with the same aspect. These six activities are different, just look: Which project type would you choose for every single activity? I don’t think you will choose every time the same ;) And that’s the point: to big projects result in a to general description and evaluation. To cut a long story short, maybe you can focus on these multi-family irrigation systems and provide some more information about this. Then you can just mention in the comment that there are more activities done by this project (maybe a short list). If you have questions you can direct contact us via mail steffen.kriewald@pik-potsdam.de, tabea.lissner@pik-potsdam.de Cheers Steffen\"",

(2) Understanding the role of an organization and its processes of decision making in relation to water stress and climate, including identificatory factors that facilitate or hinder adaptation to changing conditions and how they do it (past, present, future). The methodology was a qualitative, with descriptive and interpretive approach. Strategies for data collection included individual and group interviews and participatory strategies such as discussion groups, forums, workshops, seminars and consulting experts.",

Adaptive capacities of the sector - despite facing significant challenges that are associated with climate scenarios predict further rise in average temperatures and decreased water availability - exhibit interesting social and cultural arrangements formal and informal.",

This will be achieved through construction of lagoons for rain water harvesting and management, which will capture and store surface runoff water in the rainy season.\nThe stored water will be used during the dry season for domestic, mainly drinking and crop irrigation. This results to a reduced dependence on precipitation and its variability in time, distribution and quantity. Furthermore the project will reduce the accumulation of sediments in the lagoons through the implementation of biomechanical constructions and afforestation of infiltration trenches.\"",

        "description": "\"The GTZ Project, PROAGRO, works in two communities, Kuyoj Qhocha and Tapera, where residents are largely dependent on irrigation-fed agriculture for their livelihoods. Changes in precipitation patterns and rising temperatures in both communities have already begun to impact agricultural outputs and family incomes.\nIn many instances, men have been forced to migrate away from their homes to seek work to supplement family incomes, placing an additional burden on women to care for the homes, children, livestock and family agricultural plots. As a response measure, PROAGRO has partnered with the GTZ’s Climate Protection Program to design an adaptation to climate change pilot project that targets the special needs of women in the two affected communities. The project seeks to stabilize livelihoods and diversify incomes, without increasing the work load for women. A further goal of the pilot is to increase awareness and improve information about climate change.\nThe pilot’s activities focus on capacity building, natural resource protection and production of new crop varieties. Weather stations have been installed in both communities to provide information about temperature and precipitation that can be communicated to the national meteorological service. Community members have participated in workshops to improve their knowledge about climate change. Trainings have been carried out to adapt forest, water and soil management practices to changing climatic conditions. New crop varieties have been introduced to diversify both family nutrition and incomes, as well as improve food security. In all cases, emphasis has been placed on giving women a leadership role in managing the new activities.\"",

The individual reforestation projects are carried out on relatively small areas of land, ranging from plots of one hectare to larger parcels of 18 to 30 hectares. In each area to be reforested, the project is implemented undertaken in three stages 1. Site Selection based on social (community association in existence, community desire, viability, potential for favela expansion) and environmental (severity of slopes, presence of water sources and springs, drainage basin areas, size of site) criteria; 2. Site Preparation The site is cleared, drainage canals and roads built, and the soil plowed, with fertilizer made from composted municipal waste worked into the soil to improve nutrient content and overall soil quality. In areas with very steep slopes, terraces are built to stabilize the soil, increasing water retention and reducing erosion. At the same time, seedlings cultivated from a municipally-owned model farm forest nursery are selected by forest engineers to best suit the nature of the site being reforested. 3. Planting and Maintenance The prepared sites are planted using forest succession principles involving primary and secondary species.Resources required  labour, tools, tree seedlings\"",

        "description": "This project was designed to provide concrete recommendations and to develop strategies to build resilience to climate change amongst small-scale tea growers, and mainstreaming adaptation to projected increasing climate risk. The following measures were undertaken to improve the resilience of the small-scale farmers: Through quarterly climate preparedness workshops farmers together with scientists discussed climate change projections and trends in the Suid Bokkeveld region, including adaptation options and long term strategies. In the workshops farmers learned to integrate seasonal weather forecast into their decision making. Mentor farmers trained their fellow farmers in soil erosion control and the removal of alien species. As a result of the training farmers created wind breaks and retention buffers in their tea production areas. Through the learning process initiated by the project farmers changed to more sustainable agricultural practices e.g. mulching as a method to conserve moisture and increase plant nutrients. Finally, farmers learned to monitor the growth of wild and cultivated rooibos stands, and were able to enhance their management abilities according to findings. In the participatory research farmers discovered that wild rooibos has a greater resilience to severe climatic events than cultivated varieties. Two communities of small-scale rooibos farmers, currently organised as the Heiveld Co-operative and the Wupperthal Tea Association, have been harvesting wild and cultivated rooibos, and have become the de facto guardians of the wild rooibos genetic stock.

This was both a constraint to the project (because of the limited resources of farmers to participate in learning processes) and an incentive (as farmers are stimulated to learn more about the situation and how best to respond to it). One significant gap in adaptation support is the lack of engagement by the Department of Agriculture in the area. ",

They also have now better access to market and other resources through marketing of their climate proofing activities. Wild rooibos, for example , is much in demand by European markets and attracts a high price. Through the project farmers were able to develop a successful harvesting and marketing strategy that gave them access to those markets (e.g. fair trade and organic markets). ",
        "outcome_evaluation": "In order to be successful all project activities needed to be linked to local institutions (e.g. working with a particular rooibos farming co-operative, the Heiveld Cooperative). Project has been successful because farmers are more resilient and were able to improve their livelihoods. Here are some of the findings from the project: • There is a real enthusiasm amongst farmers in isolated communities to gain more understanding of global climatic patterns, and how these affect their livelihoods and their lifestyles. • A learning process that supports the sharing of information and experiences at both global and local scales breaks people’s sense of isolation and helplessness, and creates new capacities for positive action to mitigate the effects of climate change. • Adaptations are most effective when based on existing knowledge. • The role of formal and informal institutions at a range of scales is critical for supporting adaptation. • The project has shown that positive synergies may be found between rural livelihoods, conservation of biodiversity and successful adaptation to climate change. Finally, the learning approach adopted in the project has enhanced local knowledge and broadened farmers’ capacities to respond in a proactive manner. The project used indigenous adaptive capacity as a starting point, combined with relevant external knowledge, rather than imposing adaptation plans in a top-down manner. This allowed the development of adaptation strategies to current and future climate change in a more realistic and participatory way. ",

This is being achieved by encouraging climate-friendly behaviour through lessons and action projects that link with the curriculum. In the process biodiversity conservation and healthy ecosystems are promoted as part of climate change mitigation and adaptation. The framework of the current WESSA/WWF Eco-Schools programme forms the basis through which this is achieved, as it has a well researched and peer reviewed process framework that fosters whole school learning and education for sustainable living. Although there is no requirement to expand on the number of schools in the six climate change nodes, the number of schools has increased in 2010 from 144 to 240 and this is growing in number in all nodes, in almost all cases. Specific measures include:39 lessons on the curicculum relating to climate change, development of a climate change cartoon and theme specific educational puzzle, vegetable gardens and wetland rehabilitation activities. The project is located in the following provinces of South Africa: Western Cape, Mpumalanga, Eastern Cape, Free State and KwaZulu-Natal.",

        "description": "The project focused on increasing resilience of small scale farmers in the Swartland to climate change through offering a range of activities and climate change preparedness workshops to farmers. With the use of historical time-lines, small scale farmers related their experiences of changes in weather over the past few years and shared with members of other farming communities in the region how they were able to respond to these changes. Follow up workshops were continually evaluated and reformatted to respond to the needs expressed by the small-scale farmers. They generally included the sharing of scientific and local information, outings to see local examples of farming practice, and discussions on how farmers might plan their farming activities given the most up to date weather forecasts available on the South African Weather Service’s website. Seasonal weather forecasts were integrated into appropriate livelihood strategies including the choice of crop, timing of cropping and technological options. Farmers expressed a desire to record their own rainfall and temperature data, and were supplied by the project with the necessary and appropriate devices to do so. The information was recorded in climate diaries and discussed at the subsequent workshops. ",

The Climate Systems Analysis Group (CSAG) at UCT produced a brief report outlining a preliminary analysis of climate data from weather stations in the Swartland region. Given the limited size of the geographic area, together with the use of incomplete historical data from only 5 weather stations, CSAG emphasized that the results are not conclusive, and require further investigation and research. However, the report concludes that an increase in maximum and minimum temperatures is likely, with warming particularly in autumn. Furthermore, an increase of up to 2.5 degrees Celcius is projected for the end of the 21st century, based on the SRESA2 (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Special Report on Emissions Scenario) emissions scenario. Precipitation, given the complex nature of its drivers, was less easy to predict. Generally, precipitation is likely to stay the same, or otherwise decrease slightly. It is predicted that rainfall events will be fewer, but more intense. The report concludes that agricultural activities and livelihoods are likely to be negatively impacted by the projected changes.

Hence, 4 communal nurseries with around 45,000 seedlings were installed in the four districts.\nFollowing the good practices in Nicaragua and Chiapas, CEPICAFE started the installation of 10 solar driers in Montero to assure the coffee drying process under changing precipitation patterns. More often unforeseeable rainfalls interrupt the sun drying process during harvest season, thus negatively affecting the quality of the green coffee beans.\nFurthermore CEPICAFE supported sustainable coffee practices, like soil conservation, irrigation, fertilization, pest control or shadow management.\"",

This will serve to enhance the adaptive management capacity of the national/provincial/local government and local communities to cope with the increase wildfire risks associated with climate change. The geographical area for this project is the Western Cape, parts of the Southern Cape, including Baviaanskloof and Tsitsikamma, because wildfires in this region has been escalating with increased intensity over the last few years. This areas falls within the Cape Floristic Region, which has been declared a hotspots with key endemic species and natural resources that needs adaptive management for long-term sustainability. ",

El Niño is a recurring threat in Peru that can bring catastrophic rainfall and flooding along its northern coast. That assessment led to a focus on the region of Piura and the design of an innovative index insurance product that utilizes measures of Pacific sea surface temperatures obtained from NOAA as the basis of payment. These values are highly predictive and correlated with the extreme El Niño events and their consequences in Piura. The unique aspect of this index is that the sea surface temperatures can signal a severe El Niño months in advance of its impact on land, enabling an insurance payment to be made several months before the onset of catastrophic weather. The advance payment can then be used for risk mitigation and adaptation strategies to reduce losses and disruptions from the impending disaster.\"",

The UNDP provided additional support to develop applications of El Niño Index Insurance to rural households, farmers associations, and local and regional government agencies in Piura to facilitate adaptation to climate risks and disaster risk management. El Niño Index Insurance for risk aggregators has been approved by the Peruvian regulator and is being offered by the Peruvian insurance company La Positiva, with reinsurance from PartnerRE. Other applications of El Niño insurance (e.g., for the public sector) will be offered in early 2011.",

This guideline is meant to assist decision makers in improved management of the risks that currently arise with climate variability and those that may occur with future climate change. In this project, high resolution regional climate modelling will be applied to improve understanding of the effects that anthropogenic warming may have on thunderstorm formation over the Highveld. These modelled inputs will then be considered in a range of scenarios for planning purposes. These outputs will be workshopped with city managers so that a set of realistic scenarios can be developed.

Investigate and critically assess how each of the Municipalities in the declared southern Cape disaster areas has responded to the drought with respect to domestic water provision and how it is financed. 2. Pilot a consultative process with an affected community in the southern Cape to build an understanding of knowledge gaps and obstacles, share information, strengthen community structures and facilitate engagement with local authorities. 3. Develop resource materials which will assist vulnerable urban communities and municipalities in South Africa adapt to climate change and associated water scarcity. 4.

These will connect core conservation areas in the landscape, while improving the ability of species to adapt to climate change and allowing for long-term mitigation. The KZN Biodiversity Stewardship Programme is focused on building rural community-based initiatives that have tangible climate change adaptation value, through the core focus on improving biodiversity protection through capacity building, training and mentorship. Through the project six stewardship corridors have been estabished: Dalton Private Reserve, Red Desert Nature Reserve, Umgano Community Project, Somkhanda Game Reserve, Usuthu Gorge and the Upper Thukela community site (incorporating Mweni) Major implementation measures include: a)Removal of alien plants i.e. establishment and initiation of an alien plant clearing plan on each of the sites b)Improved grassland management on these sites, through the improved management of fire and livestock grazing training c)Training of field rangers to ensure improved biodiversity monitoring and patrolling in order to assist in understanding the role these areas play in climate change adaptation d) Improved biodiversity management on these sites, by developing and providing financial support for the implementation of a Management Plan for each initiative. e)Provide mentoring of field rangers to these community-based initiatives to ensure viability of these initiatives ",

A significant portion of the agricultural sector within the Garden Route is currently financially unstable and environmentally unsustainable. In these areas inappropriate cultivation and irrigation, overstocking, and illegal activities are causing significant damage to natural resources. The first phase of the project, included an assessment of current agricultural practices in the Garden Route, and an assessment of farmers’ attitudes towards changing rainfall patterns and other climatic variables. The second phase utilizes these findings and make recommendations relating to mitigation and adaptation strategies based on scenario planning exercise among farmers and experts. Recommendations to the farmers, Agricultural Unions, relevant government departments and politicians will be suggested , based on the outcomes projected by the models. The project includes the following components: •In depth study of the perspectives and attitudes of farmers towards climate change •Workshop with farmers for development of existing and potential adaptation and mitigation options •Creating an environment for farmers that allows them to identify of adaptation and mitigation strategies •Scenario workshop with experts and farmers •Revisiting of adaptation and mitigation options and development of adaptation and mitigation strategies by the farmers",

        "description": "The Riparian Habitat Rehabilitation Project was established to develop and implement strategies to rehabilitate key degraded riparian corridors in the Karoo. The project aims to combine sustainable water and biodiversity conservation with job creation and skills development amongst members of the local rural communities, in order to promote resilience of ecosystems and communities to climate change. The project will also act as an adaptation mechanism through the restoration of riparian ecosystems which will help buffer the Karoo communities to the predicted impacts of climate change. The re-vegetating and restoring the soils as well as connecting fragmented pieces of vegetation together will increased capability of the ecosystem to provide its services such as water filtration, reducing sedimentation and flood impacts and build resilience to the impacts of climate change. Specific Measures: 1.Develop and implement a strategy to regenerate degraded riparian zones on farms to create corridors of suitable habitat for Riverine Rabbit dispersal. 2.The ongoing development and propagation of seedlings of indigenous riparian plants in the Karoo Indigenous Plant Nursery in Loxton. 3.Training of nursery staff (i.e Seed collection, seed germination, seedling care, infrastructure management, trail maintenance, simple construction, etc.) 4.The formal mapping and recording of the planting and restoration process into a database, thereby allowing for the restoration process to be formally tracked and quantified over time. This includes monitoring for climate change adaptation. 5.Provide opportunities for members of the rural Loxton community to engage in conservation through skills training and providing employment opportunities, particularly for women and the previously disadvantaged. 6.Develop guidelines for landowners to rehabilitate degraded riparian corridors to promote long term sustainability of natural resources (e.g soil conservation techniques such as digging hollows, mashing) ",

The project works with livestock farmers to find sustainable climate change adaptation solutions, and will encourage and enable farmers to derive tangible income benefits from implementing holistic farming practices. These practices include improved catchment management of wetlands and rivers to increase stream flows ground water recharge and water quantities, the removal of alien vegetation, ensuring appropriate livestock numbers and grazing rotations for herd and veld health, soil management including erosion control, fire management as well as setting aside portions of land for erosion buffers, biodiversity corridors, etc. CI staff provide the support function to the farmers which would normally provided by agricultural extension services, which is not available due to limited resources. The area is under threat from un-sustainable farming activities, such as overgrazing, ploughing up of wetlands and indiscriminate burning. These threats are addressed through the agreements, in which farmers undertake to implement certain conservation actions, like stock reduction, cooperation with wetland restoration and the formation of a fire management plan and alternative predator control methods. In return, CI implements enabling actions that will support farmers in adopting these better land management practices. Currently the BRI has 22 members, 2 of which are private farmers and the rest communal farmers. The area thus under better management at present, on which these 22 members farm, is roughly 9000 ha.

Climate change information for the region was provided by Guy Midgley SANBI and the Climate Systems Analysis Group. The area has been identified as important to protect to ensure resilience against climate change, both in terms of species, which will be able to use the Kamiesberg as refugia because of its higher rainfall and cooler climate and in terms of human livelihoods, especially water security. The reason for the latter is that the Kamiesberg is the catchment for two important non-perennial rivers in the area, the Groen River and the Buffels River and is also home to a network of wetlands, important for catching water in the rainy season and slowly releasing it in the dry summer months.

        "description": "This project is a livelihoods program that helps poor and vulnerable members of our township and rural communities to grow a future for themselves. Wildlands Conservation Trust facilitators teach individuals in these communities how to grow indigenous trees from seed and care for the plants until they reach a certain height. These individuals are referred to as ‘tree-preneurs’. The trees are then traded back to Wildlands for food, clothes, bicycles, agricultural goods and tools, school and university fees. The trees are then either planted back into the communities or planted out in Wildlands’ forest restoration projects. The project supports the ongoing establishment of the Jobe, Ongoye and Buffelsdraai Carbon sinks and the identification and development of new sinks in southern KwaZulu-Natal and the Eastern Cape, using pro-poor development methodologies in pursuit of this overall objective. Wildlands calculates that for every hectare of the 1000 hectares being re-forested on the three sites, 3 to 41/2 tonnes of CO2 will be sequestered per year over a 20-year period. This amounts to 60 000-90 000 tones of CO2 removed from the atmosphere over the project’s lifespan Specific measures: 1.Support the growing, planting and care of 40 000 seedlings per annum, using the Indigenous Trees for Life pro-poor methodology, across the existing (and new) sinks. 2.The management of this process, with emphasis on the training and capacity building of the tree-preneurs and planting and caring SMME’s. 3.The ongoing development of the Wildlands Carbon Sink scientific process, to underwrite the medium – long term sustainability of the sinks. 4.The formal evaluation and development of new sink opportunities in the southern KZN and Eastern Cape regions. 5.Small sclale land owners plant trees on the boundaries of their properties which increases flood protection ",

The focus will be on the governance system around decisions concerning economic planning and legislation, and formal and informal sector decisions involving investment and risk. Specific components of the governance system, that will receive attention, include: • the alignment and contradictions of local policies, • better coordination between government, civil society and private stakeholders, • a two-way flow of knowledge between scales, • balancing competing needs; and • the implications of social and gender inequalities. \"",

With the completion of a range of climate change risk assessments and an increase in knowledge of future vulnerabilities, local government must consider its own liability and governance in terms of its delegations in approving plans and developments. One of the key drivers for change in the future will be legal accountability and liability for future impacts on private property and commercial developments.

Does the urgency of climate change create a new policy environment that will allow faster more directed action that is not slowed through bureaucratic means? ",

This City has completed a sea level rise risk assessment. However as a coastal City, the marine environment provides a key service to the City as a receiving environment for freshwater run-off and stormwater discharge. Burgeoning development and the attendant increases in the built environment within the City has resulted in an increase in run-off which places increased pressure on the City’s stormwater systems as well as its catchments. The City must begin to investigate and understand the potential combined effects of coastal storm surges, mean sea level rise and increased freshwater and stormwater flow. It is highly likely that these events would coincide given that the storms responsible for extreme rainfall events would often result in coastal wave surges. The combined effect of intense rainfall, high winds and storm surges has the potential to increase flood risk and infrastructure damage. ",

The country is faced with stressed water resources already and does not have a high level of capacity to cope and adapt. Consequently, a transition into a pro-active, adaptive management approach is imperative. It calls for a highly integrated management concept at catchment level, based on sound understanding of the interdependence of different key factors, such as economic and human needs, environmental requirements and management capacity under CC conditions. One starting point is a detailed analysis of the biophysical baseline and environmental as well as social-economic responses, in order equitably allocate water to all sectors. Knowledge of levels of vulnerability and policy driven opportunities of adaptability within selected catchments will bring comprehensive awareness of alternative strategies, for all of which adequate information management is also critical.",

The project will adapt a catchment model after stakeholder requirements, use high-resolution regional climate change scenarios, assess the impact of participatory modelling on stakeholders’ perceptions of climate change related to water resources, explore how to increase stakeholder confidence and twin to a participatory modelling project in Sweden to assess similarities and differences. Results of the project will illuminate how stakeholder participation can be used in order to make climate change studies more relevant and useful to the local needs in developing countries. Co-operation will be in the form of exchange of personnel, joint planning and implementation of stakeholder interviews and workshops, sharing of experiences regarding climatological and hydrological modelling and stakeholder participation in the two HELP basins.",

        "description": "The growth in awareness of global-change issues as a result of IPCC studies and reports has introduced a new and rapidly evolving focus for climate and atmosphere research in the past decade. This necessitates redefining climate-related, and particularly global climate change-related research thrusts and programmes that the Water Research Commission of South Africa (WRC) supports on behalf of the water sector. Perhaps the largest change is the need for such research to be integrated into a larger body of climate-change research nationally, which embraces a multi-sectoral, multi-level approach in order to deal with multiple stresses and enable the country to successfully face up to challenges that climate change is expected to pose over coming decades. This document sets out the background against which the development of a climate change research portfolio with a water-sector focus was initiated and pursued, with the assistance of a wide complement of stakeholders.

        "description": "\"The eThekwini Municipal Climate Protection Programme (MCPP) was initiated in 2004 as concern was increasing with regards to potential climate change impacts. The programme has been developed in a phased manner; Phase 1 focused on the assessment of local climate change impacts; Phase 2 focused on the development of an adaptation workstream with three focal areas of action: municipal level, community–level and urban management intervention. The Headline Climate Change Adaptation Strategy (HCCAS), was the fist of the municipal level interventions. This highlighted key interventions required by the municipality to adapt to climate change. Following the HCCAS of phase 2 it was recognised that sector specific adaptation plans needed to be developed in order to start mainstreaming adaptation planning into the municipality. To test this approach three pilot sectors, health, water and disaster management, where chosen, and sector specific adaptation needs identified. Work is also being pursued investigating the impacts of climate change on the city’s globally significant biodiversity and related open space system. Recognising that the resilience of local communities would also need to be increased, a parallel process of community – based adaptation was initiated, focused on livelihood analyses, food and water security issues and community reforestation projects. A third focal area has also been developed which focuses on a variety of urban management interventions, including: sea level rise modelling, a pilot green roof project and a variety of greening initiatives. The next phase of the project, phase 3, involves the development of a tool which will allow for the simulation, evaluation and comparison of strategic development in the city in the context of climate change, and Phase 4 will work towards mainstreaming climate change concerns into city planning and development.\"",

Secondly, adequate institutional, human and financial resources, as well as political will, are critical for successful implementation of adaptation interventions in the Municipality. ",
        "limiting_factors": "The project has found that in order to deal with potential climate impacts some institutional restructuring of local government activities is required. At the same time, adaptation interventions should be implemented in a manner which embeds the current activities and processes in the day to day operations of the municipality. Various sectors within the municipality have different capacities and thus different abilities to integrate climate change adaptation into their activities. A limiting factor for the project is therefore the provision of adequate institutional, human and financial resources necessary for restructuring and for the mainstreaming of climate change adaptations.",

        "no_regret_win_win": "Focus on and prioritization of climate change adaptation can make the eThekwini Municipality climate smart, and thus more able to deal with climate impacts and projected climate changes. At the same time, the assessment of municipal sector activities and the work towards finding suitable adaptation interventions can also work to highlight shortcomings in municipal structures and activities, and thus trigger necessary improvements in the Municipality. What is more, the strengthening of institutional, human and financial resources necessary to integrate climate change adaptation into municipal structures and activities also work to strengthen the general capacity of the Municipality. Positive side-effects can also be seen more directly in for example the socio-economic and catchment management benefits of the community reforestation projects. ",

While potable water was tankered in to Sedgefield, the Knysna Municipality sought an urgent solution, and alternatives were examined to implement rapid, short and medium term options. An innovative, demand-based approach was developed to address the water supply crisis in Sedgefield, and this proved to be cost effective and achievable in the time scales required. The approach included the construction of the Sedgefield desalination plant, a single-pass, reverse osmosis (RO) system that can produce potable water of 1. 5Mℓ/day. Initially the plant will be operated by the supplier for one year – which will probably be extended to three or five years. The team is justifiably proud to have commissioned the plant within three months: the contract award was signed on 1 October 2009 and the plant was functional on 18 December 2009, in time for the anticipated holiday peak in December 2009.",

The program disseminates information about techniques, and facilitates community action for implementing an action plan with funds from different sovernment schemes and public contribution. The stated aims are: (1) To construct water conservation structures through convergence of funds from different line departments. (2) To conserve water through these structures thereby contributing towards ground water recharge. (3) Equitable distribution, usage and saving of the existing water resources.",

Diverse cropping which was becoming an exception is now increasing again. • Marginal lands have become productive. Lands which used to produce crops worth Rs.250-300 per acre have started producing crops worth over Rs.4000. • Seeds that can crop about 1000 ha have been stored in villages within a span of two years and three cropping seasons. • Traditional varieties add diversity and nutritive value to the womens household menu. Forgotten foods from the past like Korra, Aargulu, Bailodlu are being consumed again. • A rethinking on the harmful effects of the new agricultural practices has started. People are shifting back, from tractor ploughing to bullocks. { Deep plough through tractor upturns the fine and fertile top soil and brings up the hard subsoil while shallow ploughing through bullocks keeps the fine soil on the upper layers itself } • Many people have started approaching the sangham women for traditional seeds, thus helping promote a local self reliant seed economy. ",
        "comments": "The community seed banks and other agricultural programs have strengthened the internal input cycle. Mulching, earthworks, use of farmyard manure has reduced erosion and degradation. A cumulative impact of all these efforts can be seen in the fact that no member of DDS sanghams need to suffer hunger since her own access to food has multiplied at least four times. In times of distress members can bank upon the grain support that these programmes can bring together. ",

This represents a substantial increase since the annual income for many farming families in this region is as low as Rs 7,000. Many farmers have doubled their income, and a few have seen it rise ten-fold. Farmers can easily pay back the Rs 1,200 to 1,300 cost of the pump from their increased earnings.Use of treadle pump allows farmers to cultivate all the year round thus increasing their cropping intensity to 200-300%,and never leave their land fallow.The income impact of the Treadle Pump technology varies across households and regions, but US$100 per year is the conservative estimate of the average increase in the annual net income of each household. Since inception in 1991, around 750,000 treadle pumps have been adopted by small holder farm families. ",
        "comments": "From year 2000 IDE have embarked on a gradual phase-out programme, based on mutual trust between IDEI and its approved manufacturers to ensure quality assurance of treadle pumps. The phase-out programme involves imparting training to the manufacturers and other IDEI channel partners so that they are able to thoroughly grasp and inculcate a high degree of quality consciousness, especially in the context of strict issuance of warranty cards and instruction manual to the farmers and their empowerment for demanding quick replacement of defective pumps.",

Swaminathan Research Foundation experimented with the establishment of village level mini agro-met observatories in selected project villages namely, Kothur and Srirangapur in Andhra Pradesh and Kundai and Amda in Rajasthan on a pilot scale. \nThe underlying hypothesis was that the data collected from the meteorological instruments by the community over a period of time would help the community to develop weather based thumb rules for taking appropriate farm decisions based on simple weather parameters like rainfall, wind speed, temperature and relative humidity.\nAbout 10 farmers, considered to be ‘Agro-met Farmers’ who used the agro-met data extensively for their farm operations and a set of ‘Control Farmers’ played a key role in demonstrating the utility value of the locally generated information besides providing useful insights on the how the enhanced capacity of the local communities, well managed local institutions help broadening the understanding of climate risks and in providing in-situ solutions. A variety of information was gathered from both the ‘Agro-met’ and ‘Control’ farmers practicing cropping system of maize (Kharif)-wheat (Rabi) through a pre-tested questionnaire and personal interviews at various stages of the crop production process.\"",

The partial budgeting analysis also indicated that there is an estimated positive change for the ‘Agro-met’ farmer group. \nThe agro-met experiment proved to be an example of a new knowledge based community empowerment that enhances its coping capacity.

The programme is presently focusing on strengthening the forward linkages of the producers of milk in Kutch through the collaborative approach of Abhiyan and Saurashtra Kutch Dairy Project (a wing of National Dairy Development Board). Under this a fodder bank programme was started in 10 villages to make them self-reliant in terms of fodder availability in drought years. The initiatives of the pprogramme are compiled in a quaterly published magazine (ChatAchat). ",

The project will construct demonstration samples in Qingdao city to show how the fresh water can be replaced by sea water in domestic usage (especially, water used to flush toilet).The project applies the main techniques developed by the Institute of Seawater Desalination and Multipurpose Utilization to reach the provision of 0.85 million m3 water per year to a community with about 33 thousand residencies. 1, When pumping water from the sea, the beach caisson means (use submarine sands to conduct the depth filtration to sea water) are adopted in the project. In this way, it is sure less suspended materials and pollutants enter into container. 2, Smells of sea water mainly resulted from alga, bacteria and microbe etc. Experiments show that both the sodium hypochlorite and chlorine dioxide can be used as a disinfector to remove the odor. 3, A storage pool for treated sea water is constructed in the community water station. The frequency conversion water supply system, which was designed to regulate water flow according to the real time water consumption and make sure the constant pressure at the pipe end, is used to provide water to the household.",

Therefore, it is recommended to compress the area of maize and generally expand the rice cultivation area.\n2, With the increase of heat resources in the river basin, change cropping/harvesting system once per year into twice or even thrice per year to raise the food production.\n3, Planting the rice with longer growth period would increase the yield of about 17-23% compared to that of original crop varieties in the river basin.\"",

This aims to help mainstream climate change adaptation measures, techniques, and activities into the national Comprehensive Agricultural Development (CAD) Program which is China’s largest national investment program in irrigated agriculture. There are three components to the project. The first component is the identification and prioritization of adaptation options. The second component is the demonstration and implementation of adaptation measures. The purpose of this component is to introduce, demonstrate and implement the specific adaptation measures in selected demonstration areas, and adjust and integrate appropriate adaptation measures into the implementation of the Third Irrigated Agriculture Intensification Project (IAIL3), in order to reduce vulnerability to climate change in the 3H Basin. Finally, the third component is the mainstreaming adaptation into national CAD program and institutional strengthening. The component will aim at integrating and mainstreaming climate change adaptation into the national CAD program, including a series of capacity building, technical assistance, knowledge sharing, public awareness activities, and preparation of a national climate change adaptation plan for CAD by State Office of Comprehensive Agricultural Development (SOCAD), with the cooperation of Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), the National Development and Reform Commission(NDRC) and Ministry of Finance (MOF) national climate change adaptation offices.",

        "description": "The development objective of the Project for China is to improve the protection of property and safety of people from flood events and bring about sustainable utilization of land and water resources within Xining Municipality. There are six components to the project. The first component of the project is flood control and management. This component will include both structural and non-structural activities including dikes strengthening, access roads, cross dike structures and water level control structures, an integrated flood warning system, and riverbank landscaping works. This component will also improve the level of flood protection in selected areas of Xining Municipality and in a comprehensive flood warning system. The second component of the project is wastewater collection. This component will support the construction of about 72.5 km of both wastewater and urban storm water collection pipelines to intercept an estimated 33 million tons of wastewater and storm water drainage, which at present flows freely to the river systems in the Municipality, to deliver to existing or proposed wastewater treatment facilities. The third component of the project is participatory watershed management. This component will involve three integrated sets of sub-activities to allow communities to respond to varying soil and water conservation, land use, socio-economic conditions in the 17 individual highest priority sub-watersheds within the municipality. The fourth component of the project is institutional strengthening and capacity building. This component will support construction of a flood warning center, provision of office equipment, consulting services, technical study and research, and training and study tours. The fifth component of the project is resettlement and environmental management. This component will support resettlement and rehabilitation of displaced persons in connection with the implementation of the project, and managing the adverse environmental impacts resulting from the implementation of the project through establishment and operation of environmental management offices, provision of consulting services, and carrying out monitoring and supervision. The six component of the project is project management. This component will support development and operation of a management information system and strengthening the capacity of Xining Municipality to carry out procurement, construction, supervision, quality control, financial management, and monitoring and evaluation with respect to the project.",

You mentioned as success factor planting the right species of trees, but in the whole description was nothing said about reforestation or similar. Of course, you can focus on the Natural Resource Management part with reforestation, but then you must describe it more in detail.

        "title": "Mainstreaming Climate Change Adaptation in Watershed Management and Upland Farming",
        "description": "\"Being an archipelagic developing country composed of more than 7000 small islands, the Philippines is highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate related events such as tropical cyclones and El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Impacts of these climatic events are further aggravated by the deteriorating condition of the watersheds in the country. The most vulnerable sectors are the upland farmers who have very limited resources and who rely on rain as source of water for farming and domestic use. To reduce vulnerability of upland farmers to climate change and at the same time ensure that the watersheds can continue to deliver the environmental services foremost among which is water, adaptation strategies for the watershed and upland farmers need to be developed. The overall goal of the project is to promote climate change adaptation by upland farmers and watershed managers at the national and local levels in the Philippines. Specifically it intends to: (1) Assess the impacts of climate variability and extremes and climate change to crop yield of farmers in Lantapan, Bukidnon and water yield of Manupali watershed, Bukidnon; (2) Develop adaptation strategies for Landcare farmers and concerned Manupali watershed managers/concerned institutions to minimize risks and maximize opportunities associated with climate change; (3) Promote a multi-stakeholder approach in the formulation of climate risk adaptation through participatory approaches and capacity building of Landcare farmers and watershed managers; (4) Develop risk communication products targeted for the watershed planners and Landcare farmers; and (5) Contribute to the preparation of the Philippines’ Second National Communication by providing case materials.\nResults indicate that climate extreme and variability affect the crop yield, farm income, soil quality and health of the upland farmers. Adaptation strategies undertaken by upland farmers to cope with the impacts depend on the nature of climatic event and the extent of their dependency on land based livelihood. Sources of information of the stakeholders as regards, climate variability and extremes and climate change include the different capability building activities of the project such as: (1) IEC during barangay assembly meetings; (2) Focus group discussions; (3) seminars; (4) trainings; (5) distribution of climate change magazine (in English and local dialect); and (6) showing and distribution of video (Heeding the cries of the skies in local dialect and English).\"",

        "description": "The project builds on disaster preparedness activities already in progress. It cooperates closely with the population affected, with local institutions, national authorities, local administrations and other organisations. The following results are being targeted: 1) Local administrations will apply measures to reduce and prevent risks, 2) Six flood early warning systems are to be fully installed and function reliably, 3) Tried and tested methods of disaster preparedness will be employed, such as flood-resistant rice varieties, 4) Knowledge and awareness of local natural hazards and risks will be increased, 5) Disaster risk management will be integrated in the local land-use and development planning process. Examples of relevant activities include the drawing-up of hazard maps, the provision of equipment for and training in flood early warning systems, training for emergency situations, information campaigns, budgeting in the municipal budget and the integration of disaster preparedness in the school curriculum.Systematic cooperation with the other components of the environmental sector programme guarantees optimum utilisation of resources, at the same time strengthening existing partnerships with local and international institutions in order to achieve the common goals. Results achieved so far: 1) regional map that identifies natural hazards has highlighted and impressed the situation upon policy-makers and the population at risk, 2) manual on earthquake-resistant construction techniques is aiding builders and property owners, 3) Villages have been given assistance in drawing up emergency plans and analysing risks, 4) Two of the six flood early warning systems planned have been in operation since April 2009. The remaining four systems will enter service in the coming months, 5) The initial test phase for integration of disaster preparedness into local school curricula has been completed.

I would suggest at least: (1) flood early warning systems (2) flood-resistant rice varieties (as an example methods of disaster preparedness, if there are more, these too) (3) Knowledge Rising, including the integration into school curricula (4) Disaster Risk Management integrated in the local land use and development planning (5) Developing Hazard maps as basis for adaptation decision support “Manual on earthquake-resistant” isn’t related to climate change adaptation. In the “Information source” field you write website. Please give us an address/link or at least the name of the website. In “Synergies to Mitigation” you write High (climate risk reduction). I can’t get the point; a risk reduction could not result directly into mitigation, right? Are there indirect effects? \"",

Friends of the Reef engages local stakeholders and decision makers in developing, testing, and implementing plans to increase coral reef resilience to major threats in the region, including climate change. This project also aims to increase awareness and advocacy activities by highlighting stories and show-cases from previous, current, and future coral bleaching in major reef countries throughout the Asia-Pacific region then using this information to call for emission reduction in regional countries. Friends of the Reef also provides collaborative management mechanisms, enabling the governments of major reef countries to enhance the management and network of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs).

Detailed maps are produced for every hazard that is likely to hit a province based on its natural features, active fault lines, past events and other factors. The maps also show the extent of the area that may be hit. An accompanying brochure helps the users locate their lands or houses and find out their vulnerability to the hazards. When information is shared through workshops and planning in the communities, residents are assisted in establishing early warning systems. Drills are held to test if evacuation plans are mastered or if these are effective. Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Service Administration (PAGASA) made the maps on floods and storm surges; Phivolcs on earthquakes, ground shaking and ruptures, liquefaction and tsunamis; and MGB on landslides. Namria handles the final production, copying and distribution of the mapsPAGASA has set up a network of community-based rainfall monitoring system in Aurora. It installed rain gauges maintained by volunteers in villages, who send rainfall data by phone, mobile phone or radio to the PAGASA stations in Baler and Casiguran towns and its weather and flood forecasting center in Quezon City.Started in 2006, Ready has been implemented in Surigao del Norte and Surigao del Sur, Leyte, Southern Leyte and Bohol where deadly disasters had occurred.The first 27 provinces identified in 2005 are Benguet, Abra, Ilocos Norte, Ilocos Sur, Cagayan Valley, Isabela, Nueva Vizcaya, Quirino, Pampanga, Zambales, Aurora, Cavite, Laguna, Rizal, Catanduanes, Antique, Iloilo, Bohol, Leyte, Southern Leyte, Eastern Samar, Northern Samar, Zamboanga Del Sur, Zamboanga Sibugay, Agusan Del Sur, Surigao Del Norte, and Surigao Del Sur.The next 16 provinces were identified in 2007 with specific target cities or municipalities. These are Cebu (Metro Cebu), Pangasinan (Dagupan City), Bulacan (Doña Remedios Trinidad, San Miguel), Agusan Del Norte (Butuan City), Western Samar (Catbalogan City), Agusan Del Norte (Butuan City), Camarines Norte (Daet), Quezon (Lopez-Calauag), Oriental Mindoro (Calapan), Aklan (Kalibo), Batanes (Basco), Zamboanga del Norte (Dipolog City), Bukidnon (Malaybay City), Davao Oriental (Mati), Mountain Province (Bontoc), and Lanao Del Sur (Malabang).\"",

        "description": "\"The program’s development objective is improved environment and natural resources management which contributes to sustainable economic growth in the Philippines. To achieve this, the program would strengthen and rationalize Department of Environment and Natural Resources’ (DENR’s) regular core functions under: (a) policy, planning and advocacy; (b) conservation and rehabilitation; © environmental management, enforcement and monitoring; and (d) results based planning and budgeting. Project components have been designed around the Department of Environment and Natural Resources’ (DENR’s) mandate and regular programs, as well as the structure of Major Final Outputs that agencies are adopting in the move toward result based budgeting. The target group for components 1, 3 and 4 will be largely Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) national and regional offices, whilst component 2 will also target Local Government Units (LGUs) and communities. Component 1 Policy, planning monitoring and evaluation: The component would strengthen Department of Environment and Natural Resources’ (DENR’s) capacity in policy, planning and monitoring for programs and activities for which it is responsible. Furthermore, it would facilitate coordination of mandates of various agencies dealing with NRM. Such coordination would increase the efficiency of resource use and increase outcomes for Natural Resources Management (NRM). It would also build capacity at Local Government Units (LGUs) for Natural Resources Management (NRM). Component 2 Integrated Eco-system Management: This component would be implemented in priority watershed areas identified. Project sites: 1) Southern Sierra Madre Watershed Cluster (Angat Watershed Reservation, Ipo Watershed, Dona Remedios Trinidad-Gen. Tinio Watershed Forest Reservem Umiray Watershed Forest Reserve, Kanan Watershed, Coastal Wetlands), 2) Bicol River Basin: Libmanan-Pulantuna Watershed, 3) Liguasan Marsh. The component would support the following: (i) participatory micro-catchment planning, management and awareness raising; (ii) rehabilitation and protection of degraded ecologically sensitive areas including riverine areas; (iii) sustainable forest management; (iv) biodiversity conservation and management within priority PAs and other biologically important areas; (v) sustainable Livelihood Improvements that support IEM; and (vi) assessment, identification and implementation of activities in aqua-silviculture and coastal areas.Component 3 Environmental Management and Enforcement: This component would specifically contribute to: (i) strengthening Department of Environment and Natural Resources’ (DENR’s) role and capacity in the implementation of the environmental impact statement system; (ii) improving enforcement of environmental laws and standards for air, water, solid and toxic and hazardous wastes through the use of command and control and market-based instruments; (iii) improving environmental compliance monitoring of the regulated community; (iv) improving the adjudication process and resolution of environmental violations and pollution cases; (v) helping the Government address the mining legacy of the past by supporting pilot mine rehabilitation and strengthening enforcement of environmental and social policies for current and future mining; and (vi) undertaking geohazard mapping of high risk areas to assist in land use planning and reduce the risk of tragedies such as mudslides that have caused massive loss of life, property and environmental damage.Component 4 Expenditure Planning and Management: In line with national initiatives for improving public sector service delivery, activities under component 4, would specifically be aimed at: (i) strengthening planning and allocation of budgetary resources. More specifically, the component would support the review and revamping of the present budgeting and planning system to ensure the development of more integrated planning/budgeting plans; and (ii) developing the specific inputs related to budgeting and planning that would need to be included in the Management Information System (MIS) developed under component 1, to facilitate a closer link between plans developed and implementation reality; and (iii) overall program coordination, monitoring and evaluation.\"",

        "description": "\"Recently, it is being recognized that the way to address climate change is to integrate adaptation policies into the sustainable development programs of the country. By mainstreaming climate change adaptation into the sustainable development and poverty reduction strategies, the most vulnerable sectors (the poor people) will become more resilient to climate change (Sperling, 2003). However, the link between climate change adaptation and sustainable development is not explicitly recognized for a number of reasons. In many cases, the climate change community has little interaction with national development planners. As a result, mainstreaming of climate change adaptation in development efforts is making little headway. This project aimed to help clarify the links between climate change adaptation and sustainable development. By engaging the policy maker community and other relevant stakeholders, the project hoped to contribute to the mainstreaming of climate change adaptation to the sustainable development agenda of SE Asian countries.\nObjectives:\nThe main objectives of the project were: 1. Synthesize research on adaptation strategies for climate change and climate variability in SE Asian countries; 2. Analyze the links of adaptation strategies to the sustainable development goals of the respective countries; 3. Hold a science-policy workshop to disseminate results and solicit recommendations; and 4. Publish the results of the study in a format that is useful to policy makers and other stakeholders.\"",

All regions share the same project’s general framework but each will develop their own methods on the basis of their respective regional contexts and prioritized needs. In the Philippines, water resources and landslides are the chosen priority topics.TroFCCA in the Philippines is the continuation of the project entitled: An Integrated Assessment of Climate Change Impacts, Adaptations, and Vulnerability in Watershed Areas and Communities in Southeast Asia (AIACC) that ended in 2006. For TroFCCA’s third year in the Philippines, the main activities consist of the development of methodology for the vulnerability assessment of the water resources, policy and literature studies, development of national policy, and dissemination of information materials. The assessment of vulnerability methods is developed mainly through literature studies and participation in international, regional, and national workshops and seminars.The Philippines is highly dependent on water resources for domestic and industrial use, irrigation, power generation, animal husbandry, fisheries and recreation activities. The country is becoming more prone and susceptible to water related disasters under weather extremes such as floods, droughts, and typhoons.Since susceptibility to water related disasters will likely increase with climate change, TroFCCA in the Philippines focuses on water resources as the priority research area. \"",

The tenurial instrument and co-management agreement based on the early signs, local fish species, mollusks, as well as shells are abound again. In terms of adopting to and mitigating the impact of climate change, mangrove is the first line of defense in storm surge along the coast. And mangrove species has the highest capacity of carbon sequestration mechanism than any other tree species. Through these two projects, linkage and support from other stakeholders were gained, such as national high-school of Ipil and Universidad de Zamboanga students are doing mangrove planting activities. Also, the Parole and Probation under the Department of Justice are utilizing their prisoners to plant mangroves trees within the project sites using the mangrove nurseries of the project.",

        "title": "Economic Vulnerability and Possible Adaptation to Coastal Erosion in San Fernando City, Philippines",
        "description": "The project investigated erosion in one of the Philippine’s more developed coastal regions. It finds that this coastline is vulnerable to the impact of erosion and that, if nothing is done, the problem will cause hundreds of millions of Php worth of damage. It also finds that a planned protection strategy is the most rational approach to adopt. Such a strategy is socially and politically acceptable, justifiable from an economic perspective and also preserves the area’s beaches along with the social services they provide. The project assessed the coastline of San Fernando Bay in the La Union region of the Philippines. It looks at approximately seven kilometers of the bay’s coastline. San Fernando Bay is a densely populated area and it was chosen because it was identified as a place where coastal erosion is already prevalent. Sea-level rise is a major concern across the Philippines and beyond. Its scale and impact are both expected to become more widespread due to climate change and sea level rise.",

The scope of the program shall include biodiversity, agricultural resources, wetlands, dry and humid lands, marine and coastal resources. The main strategies of this program are climate adaptation, quality education and direction based on the ‘public and private partnership initiatives’. It addresses the critical needs of the province for its development linked on social interaction, quality education, employment, health care, poverty eradication and for a just, clean and healthy sustainable environment accessible to all. A holistic framework for adaptation was adopted by the Provincial Government of Albay, which includes four strategic components: 1) anthropogenic and environmental adaptation efforts for the benefit of the present and future generations, 2) development of programs aimed to improve social, environmental, economic, and eco-cultural status of the communities, 3) active involvement and genuine participation of the community in the development and implementation of curricula, researches, strategies, technologies, management plans, programs, projects, and approaches that promote climate change adaptation, and 4) reserach and systematic observation, formulation, implementatation, reporting, and institutionalization of appropriate plans, policies, and mechanisms to adapt to climate change, variability and extremes through private and public partnerships",

These technologies can improve productivity; raise incomes through increased crop yields and outputs; and enhance food security of households. Low-cost systems include the Pepsee easy drip technology, bucket and drum kits, micro sprinklers, micro tube drip systems and others that have been designed by organizations such as the International Development Enterprises (IDE), along with innovative farmers. The more sophisticated, capital intensive systems are conventional drip and sprinkler systems.\"",

The “Wadi” model of tribal development is holistic in approach addressing production, processing and marketing of the agri horti produce, and thus improving incomes.The critical inputs for the wadi programme include grafted mango saplings, vermi-compost and technical know-how for soil and water conservation and protective irrigation. The other development interventions includes required measures for soil conservation in the wadis, water resource development by digging wells, creating farm ponds, gully plugging and permanent check dams to ensure protective irrigation during the gestation period. The program began with 42 families in 1982 at Vansda, today the tribal development programme covers more than 23,000 families in three blocks of South Gujarat.

According to estimates by CSA, 2 million acres (10 % of cultivated area) in AP is covered under CMSA. In 2004, CMSA started on 400acres of land in 12 villages and by January 2009 it had grown to cover 1.3million acres (over 552,000 ha). Currently, over 318,000 farmers in 3,171villages (about 12 per cent of the all villages in the state) are practicing CMSA. The program covers 18 of the 23 districts of the state.During 2008-09, the project covered about 13.81 lakh acres with 3.18 lakh farmers across 3171 villages in 18 districts of Andhra Pradesh. Mainstream agricultural research and extension institutions and other programs providing subsidies to farmers for usage of chemical fertilizers and pesticides are still skeptic and more dialogue is needed between the farmers and scientific community practicing sustainable agriculture. The current dialogue on role of agriculture in adaptation to climate change and reduction of carbon footprint through reduction in usage of chemical fertilizershas also started. This augurs for a possible second ‘green’ revolution, particularly for rain fed areas.",
        "comments": "The model of NPM approach [Non Pesticidal Management] was developed by the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture and later taken up by SERP for scaling up in other districts with World Bank support.CMSA approach is currently under scrutiny and observation by many agencies. National Mission on Sustainable Agriculture being set up by Government of India is looking at the CMSA approach as one of the key strategies to be replicated at the national level. Many farmer organizations in Andhra Pradesh and other states of India who are facing similar issues and had similar experiences on smaller scale are interested in how to convert CMSA into a people’s movement.",

In some areas, as water availability increased, farmers could go on for two crops. The 50-odd schemes co-sponsored by the GGP eventually enabled 3,000 acres to be brought under protective irrigation, benefitting a population of some 10,000 people from 1,500 families. The availability of water made possible through conservation schemes and percolation tanks meant that drinking water for the village population was accessible and close at hand and villagers, women especially, did not have to trudge across long distances for water in the hot sun any longer.\nOut of the 30 odd water councils set up in Maharshtra, few of them are still functioning and have expanded their work to lift irrigation in some tribal districts in Maharashtra.\"",
        "comments": "Several of the principles behind the organisation of the Pani Panchayat ought to be made part of public policy. First, the principle that people should have equal shares in common resources, if adopted, would revolutionise society in far-reaching ways. Today, a landless person in the village is seen as a person who has no right to resources just because he has no land. Because of this, he often also does not have political power since it is assumed he is poor and therefore his views need not be taken into account when decisions concerning his survival or that of the community are being made.

Naandi foundation (NGO) and Water Health International (disinfection technology provider) implemented an output based aid project to improve rural water services in 3 districts of coastal AP in a public-private partnership. The project aims to create community safe water schemes (CSWS) in 25 villages that lack access to clean drinking water benefitting around 12,500 poor households. Nandi Foundation undertook the mobilisationand collects user fees, and in return gets a performance based subsidy linked to the delivery of pre-agreed outputs including three months of billed water services. This output-based subsidy approach requires that tariffs paid by users for consumption cover the costs of operation and maintenance, user-fee collection, and education and communication activities with key stakeholders and vulnerable groups.Each scheme included a water treatment plant connected to a water distribution point from which users obtain water in jerry cans. This scheme involves the panchayat, Naandi Foundation and WHI with Global Partnership on Output based AID (GPOBA) subsidising the cost of setting up the water treatment plants.",

The main crop chosen was moong – grown in the summer months in between wheat and rice. Based on farmer preferences four new varieties of moong were tested through a process of mother and baby plots. The primary focus is testing & validating PVSP through farmers’ participation and dissemination of the same in nearby villages about the technology as well as the varieties tested and ultimately, developing a varietal portfolio of that area.

        "description": "The low-lying area of the Sundarbans in West Bengal is well-known for frequent floods and cyclones. Water stagnates from June-July and remains muddy upto December making it impossible to grow any crop except the low yielding variety. Ramakrishna Mission Lokasiksha Parishad (RKMLSP) undertook a unique project of Land Shaping wherein a part of a field is raised artificially under its rural livelihoods program. The idea of digging ponds to raise the low land with the help of excavated earth provided sufficient rain water for crop irrigation as well as prevented water stagnation. The available land for crop cultivation for marginal farmers was about 0.2 to 0.6 hectare each. One-fifth (20 per cent) of the land selected for LS is dug up to a depth of 2.4 meters. The excavation could be in the center of the plot or on the side – according to the shape and size of the plot. With the excavated earth, a raised bund of 75 cm, along the boundary of the area is made, to stop water from entering the area. This made it suitable for the cultivation of High Yielding variety (HYV) rice, vegetables etc. On the original low land traditional varieties of rice is grown during monsoon season and chillies, sunflower or water melon is grown during winter season using the pond water. Land Shaping (LS) combined with the Integrated Farming Systems Approach is one of the main factors for enhancing productivity in a sustainable way in the Sundarban.The Ramkrishna Mission Loka-Siksha Parishad (RKMLSP), Narendrapur works in 4 blocks in Sundarban where it has so far completed around 1,600 LS projects in small and marginal farmers’ fields in the Sunderbans area in which the low-lying flood-prone land (plots of 1 to 4 bighas) has been raised by excavating a pond, covering 20-25% area of the plot, at an appropriate position for rain water harvesting and using the excavated soil for making bunds and uplands and lifting the said pond water for irrigating the rabi crops.",

A small part of the raised land would also accommodate a cattle shed for 3-4 cows and a small poultry-cum-duck near the farmer’s house for about 15-20 poultry birds and 10-15 ducks. The cattle dung and bird excreata are used for compost making along with crop residues and farm wastes; also most farmers produce vermicomposts for raising vegetables and other high value crops.

An innovative possibility would be to explore the scope for small and medium scale hydropower to generate win-win benefits, i.e. both rural development and climate change adaptation advantages in addition to the climate change mitigation ones. There are several potential climate chaneg adaptation and human well-being benefits from small and medium scale hydropower plants. The present project has therefore been launched to analyze the effect of small and medium sized hydropower plants on the adaptation to a changed climate and the possible symbioses and trade offs with the rural development.\nThe project’s objectives are:\n1. To understand the benefits of small and medium scale hydropower plants in climate change adaptation as well as rural development; \n2. To recommend mitigation measures to minimize impacts from small and medium scale hydropower plants on environment and human well-being, especially to poor communities.\"",

Iron pipe structure is costly but more durable than bamboo. The size of polyhouse may differ depending on the necessity. The direction of polyhouse is always East to West, so that the maximum sunshine is available. The house should not be constructed in shade. The polyhouses are kept cold or hot depending upon the season. Crops growing under the polyhouse are safe from unfavourable environment and hailstorm, heavy rains or scorching sunshine, etc. The humidity of polyhouse is not adversely affected by evaporation resulting in less requirement of water. In limited area of polyhouse, insects and pests control is also easy and less expensive. By adopting the modern technology of polyhouse, the difference in the demand and supply of off-season vegetables and fruits etc. can be minimised. This facilitates in maintaining the quality of the product also.",

An endline evaluation was conducted in May, in 2008 The review after project completion states that the project covered 860 villages against the proposed 1000 villages.The project has formed 1012 NaRM-Gs, 3168 SHGs, 103 Narm-g Cluster Associations and 103 SHG Federations. Socio-economically the number of households having easy access to water increased by 42%, abandonment of jhum by 15% of the households, increase in other cultivation practices such as terrace, orchard and home garden/vegetable cultivation and an increase in NTFP collection (31%), the area under plantation increased by 2716.37 ha. The project resulted in biodiversity and forest conservation of 1835.89 km square area. The increase in overall household income as per base line and endline survey for the six districts was 66%.",

Restoration works was being carried out by the forest department since 1991 but the technique of canal building to improve easy water flow was started after the intervention by MSSRF. Canals were designed in a fish bone pattern and a trapezoidal shape. The seedlings were planted at the mid level of the canal so that they recieve water at all times but do not submerge. This resulted in restoring 520 ha of mangroves by the Village Level Institution (Eco-development Committee) and Vana Samrakshana Samiti (VSS).",

They occupy a region in the eastern Amazon which is generally characterized as a seasonally dry tropical forest with a dry season from June to December. The palms support regional peasants and indigenous groups with a reliable source of food. Few predators can access these kernels, as the fruits are very hard and it takes 5 tons of pressure to break them. Babassu kernels are good sources of oil and protein, which are often not readily available to the native populations of Amazonia. Other uses of the babassu palm include construction material, woven containers, mats, fuel and ritual applications. The palm is fire-resistant, juveniles (pindovas) can remain in the forest under-story for as long as 50 years, ultimately yielding an accumulation of up to 6,000 plants/ha.",

The Guajá provide a example of the sustainable use and management of natural resources. Indeed, Guajá management practices may serve as a model within rural development. The integration of these practices would, of course, require further studies, partnerships with NGOs, entrepreneurial cooperation, and the formulation of government policy.

        "title": "Recycling Scrap Tires into Retaining Walls",
        "description": "\"Retaining walls made with scrap tires are helping to raise living standards in the favelas of Rio de Janeiro.\nA team of researchers has discovered that the tire walls, built for less than one-third of the cost of conventional anchored concrete retaining walls used elsewhere in the city, may be more effective at stopping landslides during the rainy seasons. First the project team built a test wall in an isolated area and embedded it with measuring instruments to measure its performance. The team used a specially designed saw to slice off one side wall in each tire, tied the tires together in a honeycomb pattern using polypropylene rope, and packed them full of compacted earth. The test walls were layered up to six meters high.\nThese retaining walls are an economically viable and environmentally sustainable way of building low-cost structures. The walls could be constructed under engineering supervision, by the people themselves.\"",

Where there had initially been skepticism about the wall, some people felt that as residents of a low-income area they were being given a substandard replacement for concrete, there was now total acceptance.\nAfter seeing the wall’s success on the hillsides, citizens’ groups are already adapting them for their own uses. One small fishing community on a swampy tidal inlet in northern Rio collected tires to build a jetty, and planted it with trees and shrubs to keep tidal water from washing into their homes.\"",

The beneficiaries of the project will be reached through a training, action, spreading of knowledge and technology development program that will try to identify the factors that affect their productive conditions. To achieve this, it is intended to improve and set up a cherimoya (a native Andes-highland fruit) garden, using agroforestry techniques that will allow for the conservation and proper use of lands, using contour lines and terraces techniques. Furthermore, it will be created several norms to regulate water use in the communities of the medium and higher sites of the basin, as well as norms on sustainable use of natural resources. These norms will be strengthened through bylaws from the two municipalities that share the basin.",

In order to improve coastal protection, coastal forests in Bac Lieu Province are being afforested and restored. Conservation zones for mangrove forests administered jointly by the local population and the provincial government are being established. At the same time, the economic situation of coastal populations is being improved. The people thus become less dependent upon the coastal forests and can use these more sustainably.

        "description": "During recent years, drought has become a common occurrence in most areas in the Mekong River Delta of the Mekong region, including nine provinces in the South of Vietnam. Ninh Thuan province is one of them that are most severely affected by drought. Droughts have been increasing in number, duration, and intensity. Prolonged dry periods have caused significant damage to agriculture and changed the salinity of groundwater thus damaging aquaculture. The project’s main objectives are: 1. To assess the climate vulnerability of rural communities in the most drought-prone areas of Ninh Thuan province. As part of this study, perception surveys were conducted to identify the degree to which the perceptions of communities limited the efficacy of the activities of various intervening agencies. 2. To identify possible adaptation measures to mitigate the impacts on rural communities of ever-increasing climate variability and change, in terms of droughts, with an emphasis on identification of adaptation measures.

The increase in extreme weather events is leading to increased flooding and landslides, and to erosion and land loss along the coasts. This is also jeopardising the unique species diversity of the country. Policy-makers and the wider public have become aware of climate change impacts but a lack of consistent adaptation strategies remains. The project aims to develop strategies for adaptation to climate change and conservation of biodiversity and to implement these in specific cases. Existing structures such as the secretariat of the climate change committee will be strengthened by providing intensive consultancy and training. The development of national adaptation strategies will be supported in processes involving close cooperation with relevant government bodies, local authorities, the private sector and civil society. Moreover, tangible measures to conserve biodiversity will be financed within the context of small-scale projects. The project will also raise awareness among authorities and the population of the issues surrounding climate protection and climate change.",

Covering the Economic Zones of Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Malaysia, Philippines, Timor Leste and the Solomon Islands, the loss of biodiversity in the region could affect more than 200 million people. In response, the governments of the six countries have launched a \"\"Coral Triangle Initiative on Coral Reefs, Fisheries and Food Security\"\". The project aims at establishing two large Marine Protection Areas respectively in the Savu Sea, Indonesia, and in the Kimbe Bay-Bismarck Sea area of Papua New Guinea to increase the regions resilience to climate change. A network of smaller Marine Protected Areas will combine science-based marine protection with community-based measures matching the socio-economic needs of the local population, in order to maintain a robust ecosystem which still allows for sustainable development.\"",

In its Fourth Assessment Report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has identified with great certainty island states’ vulnerability to sea level rise, deterioration of coastal conditions, diminution of fresh-water resources and increased invasion by non-native species. \nThe project will assist the implementation of the Micronesia Challenge in designating areas for conservation, in order to build resilience to the effects of climate change and address the four threats as described by the IPCC. To achieve this, target sites are identified such as the Yela Swamp Forest in the Federated States of Micronesia, threatened by retreating coastline and advancing land development, the Northern Reefs of Palau affected by coral bleaching, and the island home of the Woja community on Majuro Atoll, which faces freshwater scarcity due to poorly planned water extraction and management. Measures undertaken are mostly conservation activities through collaborative agreements with the local stakeholders.\"",

        "description": "The Mekong Delta is particularly affected by the impacts of climate change. Rising sea levels and storms of increasing magnitude threaten the poor rural population, Viet Nam’s rice and shrimp production, and Ho Chi Minh City with increasing regularity. These hazards can be countered by improving coastal protection. Intact coastal forests attenuate the wind and waves and safeguard the embankments needed to protect the low-lying, extensive Mekong delta against inundation. The project advises and supports the provincial Agencies in the development of protective mechanisms for the coastal zone, the management and rehabilitation of the mangrove forests, and the development of implementation mechanisms. In order to improve coastal protection, coastal forests in Bac Lieu Province are being afforested and restored. Conservation zones for mangrove forests administered jointly by the local population and the provincial government are being established. At the same time, the economic situation of coastal populations is being improved. The people thus become less dependent upon the coastal forests and can use these more sustainably. In addition, local government staffs are being trained and relevant institutions are being strengthened.",

The rural, predominantly smallholder population relies mainly on traditional and highly inefficient irrigation technologies and depends greatly upon uncertain rainfall. \nThe Federal Environment Agency (UBA) is coordinating a project of adaptation to climate change in Brazil, which is starting with a workshop in Rio de Janeiro for delegates from affected rural regions. \nThe purpose of the project is to prepare the rural population to cope with increasing aridity. Tried and proven forms of local initiative for adapting to climate change will be disseminated and replicated by building networks. To this end, pilot projects on irrigation in the northeast of Brazil that are already under way will be expanded. In addition, support is being provided to establish a network of municipalities and organizations seeking to disseminate successful adaptation measures. In addition to training measures, a limited amount of technical equipment (such as pumps and irrigation equipment) is also being provided.\nThe participatory approach enables the population in the affected regions to cope better with the impacts of climate change. It is envisaged that the results of the pilot projects will be taken up in regional development plans and other strategy papers and will also contribute to the debate on adaptation measures within the context of negotiations concerning the Framework Convention on Climate Change. Moreover, the project contributes to economic stabilization and to food and income security in the region.”\"",

To this end, GTZ cooperates with the insurance regulator (CIRC), the Chinese Meteorological Administration (CMA), Chinese and foreign insurance and re-insurance companies and financial intermediaries.\nThe project identifies and analyses weather perils in all provinces of China. Through a thorough analysis of past weather events and the economic and social losses resulting from those weather events, the exposure of different households and enterprises to weather perils are analyzed. Through household surveys and client studies the potential demand for weather insurance products is assessed. All this extensive research will then result in the development of suitable weather insurance products, possibly on the basis of parametric triggers, meaning that e.g. farmers will receive insurance payouts once a certain trigger (such as a certain precipitation or water levels for a flood insurance) is reached.\"\"\"",

The commune is located at the confluence of two branches of Kon river pouring into Thi Nai Coastal Lagoon. It is a low lying and narrow delta with elevations from sea level in the range of 0.5-1.2 m and therefore has been subject to salt water intrusion and frequent flooding during rainy seasons. The project is designed and implemented by testing demonstration models for solutions to adapt to increasingly severely flooding and salt intrusion. These models should use the research results of selecting and creating high yielding flood tolerant rice varieties (such as varieties named 24SS, SH2, BM207, PC6, H43, H30) carried out by IRRI (International Rice Research Institute) in-cooperation with national agriculture institutes. Local farmers’ experiences in coping with flooding and after-flooding conditions will be fully applied in the models. Furthermore the Project aims to strengthen awareness and local capacity to adapt to climate change. Public awareness raising activities will be conducted widely in the whole commune. ",

        "description": "\"Vietnam is one of the nations most at risk from climate change, and the Mekong Delta -the main producer of rice, is the most vulnerable region in the country. A number of development agencies are providing climate-change linked assistance to Vietnam , but there has been no comprehensive study of the potential effects of climate change has been undertaken on the Mekong region. The project main objective is to develop the capacity of sectors and provincial authorities in the Mekong Delta to increase climate-resilience of programs, plans, policies, and/or projects to guide future development planning. This will result in increased climate change resilience and contribute to poverty reduction. This project have two parts: i/ modeling and assessment work to determine the likely future climate conditions in the region and their impact; ii/ identifying appropriate climate change adaptation measures for targeted areas (Ca Mau, Kien Giang Provinces) and sectors (agriculture, energy, transport) as well as development of pilot projects for scaling up and replication of project outcomes and support to collaborative mechanisms for information sharing and coordinated action on climate change. \"",

The projects goal is to contribute to the significant reduction in human suffering and negative effects of natural disasters.\nThe project objective is to reduce human suffering and negative effects of natural disasters on the most vulnerable people of Vietnam by strengthening Vietnamese capacities to adapt and respond to natural disasters that are enhanced by climate change.\nBasic idea was awareness-raising about the impacts of climate change on livelihoods and the need to be prepared to adapt. So NGOs make climate change impacts part of their focus. Furthermore The Red Cross produced two documentaries that were broadcast on national television.\nAlso the theme of climate change impacts was integrated into participatory community assessments, which resulted in the identification of community-specific vulnerabilities and solutions (e.g., loud speaker systems for early warning, construction of dams and tree barriers as defense for agricultural land against winds and salt water intrusion).\nThe project focused on 30 disaster prone coastal communes in 5 provinces ( Nghe An, Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, Ninh Thuan and Binh Thuan) which are most vulnerable areas.\"",

The project aims to delineate and mark the HTL along the coasts of Tamil Nadu by erection of stone pillars. The delineation work will be done using remote sensing and the pillars will be fixed along the coast for identification of the HTL on ground for the coastal community. The HTL will also be superimposed on the village cadastral maps to identify setback lines as prescribed by the CRZ notification. This will identify the HTL on the ground and help in implementation of the coastal zone regulation more effectively. The likely impacts would be (1) less pressure on vegetation in the setback areas as they will be clearly identified, thus maintaining storm buffers, and (1) reduce the risk of loss of property by preventing building near the coast, especially if the HTL may shift with sea level rise in the next 50-100 years.",

        "description": "This is a pilot intervention initiated by World Food Programme and the Government of Uttar Pradesh to control negative impacts of climate change on the food security of households by enhancing carbon stock of the selected villages. The measure adopted is promotion of usage of energy efficient agri and household equipments like solar lightning, bio-gas, energy efficient cooking stove, irrigation pump, etc. The use of crops that are more suited to arid regions like millets, pulsesand other cash crops. Paddy varieties better suited to dry conditions (gives lower yields but improved food security).It also includes promotion of farming practices that lower water use i.e. System of Rice Intensification (SRI), Organic farming to increase soil moisture holding capacity, mulching, bio-gas slurry to increase soil carbon and agro-forestry for carbon credits, drip and sprinkler irrigation and adopting measures for rain water harvesting. It would result in increasing the local food security, reduce the need for food aid, increased carbon stock and reduced green house gas emissions, awareness and capacity building of the village communities.",

During this period some experience was gained in promoting alternate crops with lower water requirements. Building on that, this research study has identified alternate cropping patterns for the state of Tamil Nadu based on soil, climatic resources, surface water availability and social requirements. Alternate crop combinations are suggested based on the amount of rainfall and specific crop varieties identified for seven different agro-climatic zones. Crop combinations are developed for three rainfall and drought scenarios - normal rainfall (+-19% of average rainfall), moderate drought (-19-59%) and severe drought (>-59%) situations, and keeping in mind the water availability context - specifically for command areas, tank fed areas, well irrigated and dryland areas. Efforts have been made to propose cropping pattern that are economically viable. Farmers may choose the appropriate cropping pattern, based on the seasonal rainfall forecast given by Department of Agricultural Meteorology, fifteen days before the start of the season. ",

These are traditionally organic practices and the study documents the organic practices – crop growing methods, input supplies and harvesting procedure, and can help with certification, thus helping maintain them as organic. The crops have been selected based on the knowledge of cultivation and farming, the economic returns, nutritional value and also because these crops are being promoted for the rehabilitation and resettlement of shifting cultivators as they can address the livelihood and food security needs of the people. Organic agriculture systems enhance biological diversity, increase soil biological activity, maintain long term soil fertility and recycle wastes of animal and plant origin thus minimizing the use of non-renewable resources. They also improve soil moisture retention. All these characteristics of organic practices in horticultural crops will give sustained production with minimum inputs thus reducing the need for shifting cultivation for livelihood. Because the organic agricultural systems are more diverse they have greater flexibility to cope with adverse effects of climate change leading to higher economic and ecological stability and also because they have low input costs, the risk of partial or total crop failure will be lowered.",

The technique involves digging a checkerboard network of shallow recessed squares a few metres in length and under 1ft deep with an overall bund on the three lower sides in a U-shape along moderate sloped plains. A 2 km by 1.5 km area of pastureland would have choukas dug around the edge of the area with two foot high bunds creating a barrier surrounding the field. Each Choukha fills with water and excess flows to the next interconnected chaukha and so on. This system retains soil moisture beyond the monsoon to rejuvenate dry pasture lands and capture and divert rain water for ground water recharge and future use into low lying water tanks and ponds. The system is suitable for arid and semi-arid areas. The choukas have enabled the conversion of dry wastelands to fodder rich areas and has also helped increase the diversity of medicinal herbs and avian fauna.",

But convenient and efficient design, construction quality and back-technical support are key in ensuring that units are used over time. The MPRLP was declared an implementing agency for biogas plants in September 2008 by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, Government of India. Project villages in 9 districts had the potential but with no trained manpower for the activity. MPRLP biogas program started by conducting training for staff to orient them, followed by mason and user trainings. Energy promoters training with a specially designed tool kit, which helps for repair of plants. About 5000 units have been built in two years and the design and institutional structure has been improved. Around 70% of these units are functional. The key benefits of the bio gas units as perceived by the community is the time saved in travelling long distances by the women to collect fuel wood and avoiding seasonal issues – of lantananot being available after February, and wet fuelwood in the monsoons. Also most houses own some cattle with low milk yields – their dung can be put to use for the bio gas units.",

The initial bank deposit was for a five year term and the interest subsidized the reduced price the villagers paid when they bought the grain in lean times. Therefore, after the initial investment by DDS in providing small loans to bring land under cultivation, the Community Grain Fund did not require outside assistance, and continues to fund new cultivation, increasing the amount of food produced and consumed locally, as well as local employment possibilities.",

The vulnerabilities will be assessed using a mix of secondary literature to understand the nature of occurrence of climatic hazards, hazard mapping, genarating an analytical model to indicate area under inundation under different levels of SLR and bio physical and socio economic impact assessment. Based on the vulenrability and impact assessments, the study would bring out policy recommendations.

SRI was promoted on large scale through demonstrations, organizing training, field visits with active involvement of farmer’s, project facilitators and people’s representatives. Seeing the initial success farmers started adopting this technique with the help of project team. In 25 blocks in 4 districts the land cultivated under conventional method is around 1,633,329.67 acre. More than 189,594 households of 1505 villages grow paddy through conventional technique. In these 25 blocks, the SRI is practiced by 10181 households spread over 641 villages and 8924 acrea of area. An input output analysis of the conventional method of rice cultivation and SRI, the yield increase from an average of 15 to 36 quintals per ha or 140%. The gross return (@ Rs 800/quintal of paddy) is Rs 12000 under conventional practise and Rs 28800 after SRI and the cost of cultivation is Rs 2695 under conventionel method and Rs 3065 under SRI method, so the net returns are Rs 9305 and Rs 25735 respectively – an increase of over 170%",
        "comments": "SRI can play an important role in enhancing rice productivity, maintaining soil fertility with well ecosystem preservation . It is water saving (by 25-50%) and seed saving (by 50-80%) besides increased yield (at least 25-50% but usually over 100%). The location specific changes should be made and permitted while promotion and popularization of SRI. Theses changes would facilitate the farmers for quick adoption on larger area.",

In addition to fuelwood, they provide an additional source of fodder for livestock and act as a safety asset in times of crop failure. This becomes more important under Climate Change to reduce the impact on the forest. With a view to increase peoples participation in forest protection and management the Rajasthan Forest Department collaborated with the Barodiya Panchayat in Jaipur district, to plant a total of 73 acres in the years 1985, 1992 and 1993 with species like Acacia tortilis, Eucalyptus spp. and Dalbargia sissoo. The plantation provided the communities with fuel wood, fodder and timber benefits. A management plan was prepared to harvest the plantation after completion of its rotation period. Based on the harvest plan, an auction was held which led to high bids and the revenue was divided equally between the community and the forest department, as per the state government order S. F. (17) 11 Raj./8/82-A/ on June 5, 1982 regulations.",

Tribals were encouraged to make collective savings of grain soon after the harvests and Agragamee helped by matching the amount of grain collected for the first 2-3 years. They can borrow grains at a nominal rate of interest set by the community institution, which they can repay the following year after the crop is harvested. The village communities used the established traditional method of storing in grain bins and polished bamboo baskets once the grains were dried on bamboo mats, plastered with cow dung. On an average 1 basket holds 4-5 quintals of grain which can be kept for one year.",

The Mangroves are extremely important to the coastal ecosytstem as they act as soil binders and diffuse impacts of storms. They are a natural habitat for fish, prawns etc and support the fish and shrimp economy and are also habitat for the Royal Bengal Tiger and important for the biodiversity of the region. The WB Forest Department has issued Govt. Orders for formation of Forest Protection Committees (FPC) around the Reserved/ Protected Forests, and Eco-Development Committees (EDC) around the National Park and Sanctuaries of Sundarban region also. Till now, 52 FPCs and 14 EDCs have been registered. They get a 25% share of the entry fee receipts (Rs 10/day per person) from visitors to the SBR. After formation of FPCs/EDCs instances of felling, poaching, have reduced and tiger survival after village visits has increased. The user groups are involved in some of these plantations as well.",

These pits collect runoff water and store it for use during dry spells. These pits are usually about 1.5 meters deep and water is manually lifted and applied to fields. Five percent is the minimum area for supplying the required irrigation to upland paddy during its critical growth periods immediately after monsoon. Farmers can make bigger or deeper pits depending on land availability and soil type.

The three targeted provinces suffer the most frequent and persistent flooding in the Mekong. In 2002, large-scale flooding lead to the death of 163 people, destruction of houses and the spread of water-related diseases.\nProject has three main components:\n1. Community-based disaster management: Facilitating changes in the way communities prepare for, adaptation, respond to and recover from disasters implemented at both village and commune level.\n2. Institutional capacity building: Building the capacity of CARE’s implementing partner Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (DARD) by raising the understanding of and skills to apply participatory approaches and methodologies as well as adaptation and preparedness measures amongst DARD members.\n3.

        "description": "\"The coffee tree is one of the most important and traditional activites in the Brazilian agriculture. And might be appreciably affected by the climate changes, mainly with the temperature increase.There are already some researches that show promising techniques to minimize the climatic extreme effect, such as coffee crop grown shaded. Besides the adaptation of coffee crop in warmer environments using management techniques, some agroforestal systems are being adopted for carbon mitigation. The aim of the present study is (i) evaluate the potencial of shade coffee crop using different fruit trees and forestry in order to decrease the temperature in the full sun coffee crop, promoting the coffee adaptation in climate change effects; (ii) quantify the carbon balance in the system soil-plant-atmospher to assess the potencial for carbon sequestration in different shading system; (iii) evaluate the biomass production through of the more advanced remote sensing methods.\"",

We only have some minor suggestions to improve the content for the database. Since the focus of the platform is on adaptation, we would suggest renaming the project to something like ‘Adaptation of coffee crops to climate change through increased shading’. It would also be great to have some more information in the ‘Evaluative Information’ part. Anything that gives more insight into challenges you have encountered or a general evaluation of whether the projects seems to be a success would be great. You can go back to your project at any time to add or edit information, also after it has been moved to the database. Thanks again and also Jürgen Kropp sends his regards!",

        "description": "WWF India in collaboration with other WWF Netherlands, Hewlett Packard and GTZ recently inaugurated a Climate Adaptation Centre on the Sundarban island, which aims to help Mousuni villagers better handle climate change by providing integral services such as an electronic early warning system, disaster preparedness kits, knowledge, resources and skills for adapting to climate impacts and educational materials for students. Disaster Management Teams and 6 task forces within each team have been made and trained within the 4 Mouzas in Mousuni. The task forces comprise of the early warning team, evacuation and rescue team, primary health team, water and sanitation team, disaster relief management team and advisory team. The leaders for each of the team are selected unanimously by the other members and in the event of any disaster the leaders of the early warning team hear the warning on the radio or receive an sms and inform the rest. The Climate Adaptation Centre provides rice seeds to the farmers and also holds information about the various varieties of rice, their market values and benefits of government schemes and programmes.",

As the market value of this variety (tal mugur) is not far behind other high-yielding varieties, farmers on the island have been successful in maintaining their livelihoods without having to worry about losing crops to salt water incursion. Also, the number of volunteers in disaster response teams has significantly gone up. At present a community elected institution runs the centre with support from WWF.",

However, from April 1, 2008 the Act covers all of rural India. It provides a legal guarantee of 100 days of wage employment in a financial year to every rural household whose adult members volunteer to do unskilled manual work at the minimum wage rate notified for agricultural labour prescribed in the state or else an unemployment allowance. The main objective of the Act is to supplement wage employment opportunities in rural areas. \nSome of the key features of the Act are : \n-100 days of employment to a local rural household if it demands it and is willing to do unskilled manual work \n-A Job Card is necessary for demanding employment under NREGA. \n-A written application by a Job Card holding family to the Gram Panchayat or Programme Officer is necessary for demanding employment \n-All adult members whose names are on the Job Card can apply for employment. The entitlement of 100 days of employment in a financial year is for a household as an aggregate. \nCreation of durable assets and strengthening the livelihood resource base of the rural poor is one of the main objectives of the Scheme. The permissible works under this Scheme are: \n-Water Conservation \n-Drought proofing (including plantation and afforestation)\n-Flood control and protection works including drainage in water logged areas\n-Land development\n-Minor irrigation, horticulture and land development on the land of SC / ST / BPL / Indira Awas Yojana and land reform beneficiaries. \n-Rural connectivity to provide all-weather access \nThe most important aspect of this Scheme is ensuring that there are a sufficient number of works that are available to respond to the demand for employment within 15 days of demand. The role of Gram Sabha and Gram Panchayat in the planning process is that the Gram Sabha should identify and recommend works and the Gram Panchayat should consolidate and send the recommendations of Gram Sabha to the Programme Officer. The Central government outlay for scheme is 401 billion or Rs. 40,100 crores in FY 2010-11. \"\"\"",

These NREGA activities and the resulting environmental services contributed to increased crop and livestock production.\n3. There was no example of any significant scale negative impacts from any of the NREGA activities implemented.\n4. NREGA activities also reduced the vulnerability of crop production, water availability and livelihoods to uncertain and low rainfall, low water availability and poor soil fertility.\n5. The field studies in Chitradurga have clearly demonstrated the potential of NREGA activities to provide environmental services as well as to reduce vulnerability, despite the short period of only 1 to 3 years to deliver the services. Longer period of 5-10 years is needed to realize the full environmental services or vulnerability reduction potential, due to the gestation period involved (e.g., ground water recharge, soil fertility improvement and forest growth).\n6. NREGA activities were not implemented in the villages according to any micro-plan or watershed plan or in any sequential manner. Despite this limitation, many NREGA activities have the potential to provide guaranteed benefits. Examples of such activities for Chitradurga district are:\n• Desilting of water bodies accompanied by silt removal and application to crop fields\n• Land development leading to land leveling and cropping\n• Afforestation (as a drought proofing activity) with appropriate species choice\n• Construction of percolation tanks.\"",
        "comments": "\"Several impact assessment studies have been carried out on NREGA. (1) Independent surveys by economists such as Jean Dreze, found that NREGA workers had to put up with numerous infringements of their rights without being able to do much about it: lack of work, delays in wage payment, non-payment of minimum wages, absence of worksite facilities, were common. Most of these irregularities remain unaddressed, often even unnoticed. The persistence of corruption is another aspect of this lack of accountability. Three related problems that have contributed to this state of affairs are: confusion about the operational requirements of the Act; absence of any grievance redress system; and lack of independent monitoring. (2) Winrock India carried out a study of district level convergence between MG-NREGS & ongoing schemes of different Departments/ Ministries to ensure effective convergence for durable asset creation and promote strengthening of the livelihood resource base of the rural poor in the districts of Betul and Sehore in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh in India. It was found that at the district level, convergence is primarily limited to the planning stage itself, with elaborate discussions at the district level meetings amongst the concerned departments. Meanwhile, with inputs from the project team of Winrock, a few plans were developed in the two pilot districts for convergence between MG-NREGS and some line departments’ schemes such as those of Water Resource Department, Forest Department, Agriculture/Horticulture Department through involvement of KVKs for training & extension activities, Sports Department and Fisheries Department. (3) Another impact assessment was carried out by the Professional Institutional Networking (PIN) of Ministry of Rural Development, sanctioned by United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in the three districts namely Sirsa in Haryana, Sirmaur in Himachal Pradesh and Hoshiarpur in Punjab. Some of the main findings main findings of Panchayat perception, worksite verification, workers and non workers assessment of NREGS are: Role of Gram Panchayats is becoming extremely crucial in planning and implementation of the rural development scheme. Elected Panchayats in districts of Sirsa and Sirmaur reported that they received training, whereas only one fifth of the Panchayats in Hoshiarpur district received training on NREGA. Regarding the Panchayati Awareness about Measurement Book (MB), it was seen that Panchayats awareness with regard to measurement Book among Panchayat members is very good in Sirsa as compared to Hoshiarpur and Sirmaur District GPs. On the impact of NREGA on employment genaration, all the Panchayats reported that economic condition of the wage earners has improved and moreover the workers need not to go outside the village to seek work. The common problem areas quoted were: lack of Proper trained staff, delay in receiving funds and lack of awareness on different aspect of NREGA guidelines and convergence with other department etc.\"",

These warnings range from changes about the weather conditions, cloud movement, wind direction and speed, activities of animals and birds and any specific changes occurring in the development of plants. These practices can be used by the communities to rely on their own indigenous warning system about the changing weather and thus reduce the heavy losses that are incurred due to unexpected weather changes.",

        "description": "Sukhomajri is a village in the erosion prone Shivalik hills near Chandigarh in north Indian state of Haryana where there was a severe problem of erosion in the upstream catchment area leading to silting up of the downstream Sukhna Lake. In 1977 under the guidance of PR Mishra four tanks were built to conserve rainwater. This increased water storage and provided protective irrigation to the rainfed crops, increasing yields. This became an incentive to the villagers to stop grazing and initiate afforestation and watershed protection in the catchment, to reduce erosion and prevent sedimentation of their tanks. As many of the graziers did not own land and thus would not benefit directly from the water and increased yields, an innovative step was taken – of spliting water ownership from land ownership. The water stored was made the property of all villagers – equally shared by both land holders and landless, thus the landed bought water beyond their share from the landless folks. The project gave increased yields in agriculture, protected forest cover, and reduced erosion. The dam and catchment management was undertaken by Hill Resource Management Societies (HRMS) and HRMS were set up in scores of villages in the region.",

        "description": "The Central Ground Water Board (CGWB), under the Ministry of Water Resources, had implemented a study on Ground Water in the IX plan in which recharge structures were constructed in areas where water scarcity existed. The performance evaluation studies indicated increased availability of ground water especially in lean months. In the X plan a rain water harvesting and artifial recharge to ground water was taken up in over-exploied blocks of four states. In the XI plan, the scheme of Artificial Recharge to Groundwater through dugwells has been taken up under the mandate of the Overall Master Plan for Artificial Recharge to Groundwater, prepared in 2002 by the Central Ground Water Board. This scheme promotes ground water recharge by promoting and financing the construction of dug well recharge structures for the 4.455 million existinging irrigation wells. This includes a filter pit for simple filteration of rainwater that is then diverted into existing wells for groundwater recharge.This scheme is implemented in 1180 blocks of seven states namely, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat & Madhya Pradesh at an estimated cost of Rs. 1798.71 crores given by the Ministry of Finance through NABARD. The scheme provides 100% subsidy to marginal and small farmers and 50% subsidy to other farmers. An increase in ground water recharge will improve agricultural production (irrigation) and drinking water supply, enhance drought mitigation and benefit economic development. It will also mitigate ground water quality problems such as that of floride.",

In this area, an NGO Development Suppor Center is already working for strengthening the repayment system as a reult of which they are able to recover the water charges. At present the WUA charges Rs.200 to 250 per bigha per year for irrigation which is deposited in the WUA accounts. The Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh has awarded this project for excellent irrigation work. The tail end users are also a part of the decision making committee are benefitted. The total area in Man & Jobat is 25000 ha, 15000 ha in Man &10000 ha in Jobat. Nearly 5000 ha of area was already irrigated from before this project. From 2008 onwards through continuous efforts under this projec, now nearly 18000 ha of area has been irrigated out of which 7500 ha is in Man (before project it was only 2000 ha area)&10500 ha in Jobat(before project it was only 3000 ha).

Presently, public infrastructure such as roads, long-term weather forecasts, and agricultural research and extension are inadequate to secure adequate adaptation. This project will assess quantitatively how climate affects current agricultural systems and will predict how these systems may be affected in the future by climate change under various global warming scenarios, and suggest what role adaptation could play. Therefore the project will implement a series of annual workshops over a three year period to provide country teams with tools necessary to conduct. Furthermore the project will culminate with an international conference aimed at high-level economists, scientists and policy makers from the region, to disseminate regional knowledge on the vulnerability of the agricultural sector to climate variability and climate.",

It will do so by means of five pilot projects in rural and urban populations. The project will emphasize the generation, organization and communication of information on the risks resulting from climate change, climate variability and extreme climatic events, as well as preparation for their effects on food security (Cameroon, Ethiopia, Kenya) and water supply (South Africa, Burkina Faso). The lessons drawn from the five experiments can then be applied in larger scale projects. The ACCCA project is currently supporting 19 adaptation pilot actions in 17 countries across Africa and Asia. The pilot projects selected for funding under ACCCA each aim to achieve the following objectives: • Identify and prioritize climate risks to stakeholders and the climate influenced decisions that they face; • Assess available knowledge about risks and adaptation opportunities, as well as synthesize the knowledge in terms that are directly relevant to stakeholder concerns and decision-making needs; • Develop, test and disseminate risk communication materials that are designed to assist adaptation decisions; • Use the risk communication materials in stakeholder forums to develop recommendations for climate change adaptation and promote their adoption; and • Identify critical knowledge gaps that impede effective adaptation decisions and design assessment activities that would generate new knowledge to fill them. \"",

        "description": "Hyderabad is an emerging megacity in Southern India. Rapid increase of population and fast economic growth cause expanding energy and resource consumption and constantly increasing greenhouse gas emissions. Climate change will lead to extreme weather events, disastrous floods, strong heat waves, extreme droughts and increasing water scarcity. One third of the population is living below poverty line and suffers from severe food and health problems. In this particular environment, responding to the anticipated climate change impact requires exploring greenhouse gas mitigation and adaptation strategies and ways towards increased energy efficiency and renewable energy. The core hypothesis of the Project is that “getting the institutions right” is one main key to solve the problems of sustainable resource use and to achieve a sustainable development of the Hyderabad region.",

Approximately 12 people are likely to share a latrine on average (2 families). The sanitation intervention will be done in tandem with a clean chulas project: The smokeless chulas (cooking stoves) will be distributed to around 80 families who are currently using the inefficient traditional concrete or mud stoves. Both, the latrine and chulas program will encompass education materials, posters, demonstrations.",

        "description": "During the last years the output from agriculture was reduced in Motumula due to drought, shorter, unseasonable, and more intense rainfall causing for example flash floods. To stop wasting rainwater that runs through a drainage canal in Motumula’s agriculture fields during the monsoon period, farming leaders would like to dig a pond in the irrigation canal, which is 150-200 meters away from the large irrigation tank built by the state government for 14 villages in the area. From the pond, the water can be pumped to the 600 acre agricultural tank. The pond will fill during heavy rain, at which time pumps will lift the water into the agricultural bund area. The tank digging and check dam in the canal will create a water storage of many thousands of cubic meters of water.",

        "description": "Through clean and decentralized solar energy, unaffected by the frequent power outages in the village, Thirumalai Nagar’s schools, community temples, latrines, fishing equipment storage areas and other public places will receive solar lighting via the AdaptCap project. The project will address safety issues, especially for women using the latrine and to protect against vulnerability from grid power outages at night. The solar lighting in boat docking areas will help fishermen to work more safely even in times of power outages and thus adapt to more difficult circumstances for their livelihood brought on by climate change, in particular extreme weather events like storms. Self-sufficiently supplied by clean energy, the solar lighting will contribute to climate change mitigation as well as adaptation.",

        "description": "The salinization of ground water and agricultural fields threatens Chinnakaramedus population. Due to higher temperatures and floods, agriculture is more and more at risk. Therefore, leaders of the farming community have asked for a pond to link with a fresh water drainage canal requiring renovation to join up with the flowing canal a few hundred meters north of the village. Farmers need the pond to collect rainwater from the existing ditches dug around the field and to be available to pump out for irrigation to cultivate paddy in clay soil and ground nut in sandy soil. The project will also encompass the construction of a bund around the pond to protect it from any saline floods and a fence to protect from other contamination. ",

The overall objective of this project is to improve the framework conditions for the sustainable management of forest ecosystems in order to preserve the supply of goods and services in the face of climate change. The project concerns selected countries in the MENA region whose forest resources are significant : Algeria, Lebanon, Morocco, Syria, Tunisia and Turkey. The project is designed around four components: 1) Capacity building of the forest administrations in terms of climate change and enhancement of the value of goods and services provided by forests; 2) Inter-institutional relations with partner sectors to increase the appreciation and acknowledgement by these sectors for the goods and services provided by forests; 3) Communication, information and awareness raising of the general public, particularly as to the expected impacts of climate change and the socio-economic importance of the goods and services provided by forests; 4) Mobilization of external support and partnerships. \"",
